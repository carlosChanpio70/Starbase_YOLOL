#About
Before installing an code make sure to ***pause*** the YOLOL chip on the first line.\
Incase your code gets stuck then just respawn your ship.\
The setup area on readmes show all you have to do for installation,\
it is not recommended to do anything other than what it says,\
although changing fields in the code by yourself as long as\
you know what you're doing is fine.
